#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The pure parts of scripts/pr-ready-audit.sh, exercised against fixtures: the lane and its
# severity set, the two review parsers (the workflow's fenced JSON verdict and the frontier
# prose form), the frontmatter id match, the newest-check-run choice and the ledger-row parse.
# Everything that talks to GitHub or git is out of scope here; the audit's behaviour on a live
# pull request is observed on the pull request.
#
# Each case names the defect it exists to catch, so a green run says what it proved:
#   MUT-LANE-LABEL-INPUT         the lane came from a label, not the branch prefix
#   MUT-P3-LANE-DEFERS           the P3 lane let a P3 be deferred
#   MUT-JSON-SPLIT-BY-REGEX      findings read by splitting text on "},{" instead of a parser
#   MUT-NULL-WITNESS             a null witness field counted as a witness
#   MUT-MUST-UNSEEN              a MUST deviation was not flagged
#   MUT-BAD-SEVERITY-PASSES      a P9 finding passed as deferrable
#   MUT-STRAY-TOKEN-UNSEEN       a severity token outside the verdict object was ignored
#   MUT-VERDICT-FROM-PROSE       the verdict was read from prose, not the object with the findings
#   MUT-QUOTED-JSON-IS-JSON      a prose review quoting JSON was parsed as the JSON form
#   MUT-PROSE-HEADING-FINDING    a prose P1 written as a heading vanished
#   MUT-PROSE-LAST-VERDICT       the first VERDICT line won over the last
#   MUT-FRONTMATTER-BY-SUBSTRING an id in prose satisfied the frontmatter match
#   MUT-FRONTMATTER-PATTERN      an id with a dot matched as a regex
#   MUT-CHECK-RUN-FIRST-SUCCESS  an older success outranked a newer failure
#   MUT-CHECK-RUN-UNSTARTED      an unstarted run was ordered by a stand-in date, not its id
#   MUT-LEDGER-HEADER-AS-ROW     the header or separator line parsed as a row
#   MUT-REVIEWER-FROM-ORG        an organization owner was trusted as the reviewer, so the
#                                comment filter matched nothing and every pull request read
#                                no-review
#   MUT-REVIEWER-OVERRIDE-IGNORED  an explicit --reviewer was not preferred over the owner

## Frontier review of `c3a6665` (gpt-5.6-sol, max effort)

**VERDICT: PASS**

<details>
1. **P2 — The claimed closure fails.** Detail.

2. **P3 — A scope claim does not match the diff.** Detail.

### P1 — data loss written as a heading, which a numbered-only parser would miss.

I found no MUST deviation.

# Gate: the internal module notes and the source agree, in both directions.
#
#   N1  Every `Extended notes:` marker in src/ is spelled exactly
#         //! Extended notes: `docs/internals/<module>.md`
#       where <module> is the marker's own file with `src/` and `.rs` stripped,
#       and that notes file exists. Nothing else on the line: no anchor, no
#       prose, no other comment form.
#   N2  Every docs/internals/**/*.md (except README.md) mirrors a Rust module
#       that exists, and that module carries exactly one marker. A notes file
#       whose module lost its marker is caught from this side.
#   N3  Every notes file links back to its module, and the link resolves from
#       the notes file's own directory to the repository root, at any depth.
#   N4  A module carries at most one marker, and it sits above the first code.
#
# An absent docs/internals/ is a failure, never "nothing to check": with
# markers in src/ it is a deleted notes tree, and with none it is a gate
# measuring nothing. Both refuse.

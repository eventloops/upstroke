# Standards sweep

§6 (shared ownership, locks, clones) and §7 (the `?` operator) were tightened on 2026-09-03. They
bind new and materially changed code immediately. The existing tree predates them and is being
brought up to them one file at a time: each file gets a deep review by a frontier model, then a
pull request that lands the cleanup and adds the file to the table below.

Until a file is listed here, an existing `Rc`, `Arc`, `Mutex`, `RwLock`, `clone()` or `?` in it is
not a review finding unless the change under review touched that line. Once a file is listed, §6
and §7 apply to it in full, and a reviewer may cite them against any line.

Baseline at the tightening (master `cfec136`, 114 Rust files under `src/`):

| Construct | Sites | Files |
|---|---|---|
| `Arc<` | 81 | 20 |
| `Mutex<` | 145 | 32 |
| `Rc<` | 4 | 2 |
| `.clone()` | 1,941 | 84 |
| `?` (propagation) | ≈1,200 | 71 |
